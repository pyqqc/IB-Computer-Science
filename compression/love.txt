I love you not because of who you are,but because of who I am when I am with you.
No man or woman is worth your tears,and the one who is ,won’t make you cry.
The worst way to miss someone is to be sitting right beside them knowing you can’t have them.
Never frown,even when you are sad,because you never know who is falling in love with your smile.
To the world you may be one person,but to one person you may be the world.
Don’t waste your time on a man/woman,who isn’t willing to waste their time on you.
Just because someone doesn’t love you the way you want them to,doesn’t mean they don’t love you with all they have.
Don’t try to hard,the best things come when you least expect them to.
